The assumption that strategy is related to the institutional environment requires elaboration, because initial work in the new institutional theory focused on structures and practices in governmental and educational organizations (Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Meyer and Scott, 1983; Tolbert and Zucker, 1983). Several researchers have extended institutional theory to the strategies of for-profit businesses, the importance of which was noted by Powell (1991) and Scott (1994: xx, 1995: 140), among others.

Strategy researchers using a cognitive perspective suggested that managers in an industry develop a cognitive consensus about what strategies are proper and reasonable, in other words, legitimate (Huff, 1982; Porac et al., 1989; Reger and Huff, 1993; Spender, 1989; Suchman, 1995). This consensus develops from interactions with the task environment, a subset of the organizational field used by institutional theorists. Thus, this theory assumes that strategies can be legitimated by institutional forces in both the organizational field and the general environment.

 Monitoring the process of institutionalization-its costs as well as benefits-is a major responsibility of leadership. Thus institutional theory traces the emergence of distinctive forms, processes, strategies, outlooks, and competences as they emerge from patterns of organizational interaction and adaptation. Such patterns must be understood as responses to both internal and external environments. As I pointed out at the time, "distinctiveness" should not be taken too literally. We may be describing the formation of a certain kind of institution

Community interdependence models, which highlight interactions among multiple organizational (sub)populations, provide a way to analyze competition within and between the multiple strategic groups comprising an industry. An ecological approach to strategic groups informs research in strategic management by providing a model of the effects of organizational strategies and strategic group membership in dynamic populations.
