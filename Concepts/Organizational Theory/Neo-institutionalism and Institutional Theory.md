[[Selznick, 1996 - Institutionalism Old and New]]
My Leadership in Administration (1957) is often cited as a source of the "old" institutionalism in organization theory.

The new institutionalism in organization theory and sociology comprises a rejection of rational-actor models, an interest in institutions as independent variables, a turn toward cognitive and cultural explanations, and an interest in properties of supraindividual units of analysis that cannot be reduced to aggregations or direct consequences of individuals' attributes or motives. (DiMaggio and Powell, 1991: 8)

Organizational environments are more than simply 'sources for inputs, information, and knowhow for outputs' (Scott and Meyer 1983: 158). Institutionalized rules and
beliefs about organizations also figure prominently (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Meyer and Rowan 1977). Institutional theory emphasizes that organizations must
conform to these rules and requirements if they are to receive support and be perceived as legitimate.

Neo-institutional theory and interpretation has emphasized how
institutions are constituted through the cognitions of actors who both effect and are affected by institutionalized scripts for behavior. Thus, Meyer and Rowan (1977), in their most often quoted passage, described as a fundamental characteristic of modern institutions the production of "rationalized and impersonal prescriptions that identify
various social purposes as technical ones and specify in a rulelike way the appropriate means to pursue these technical purposes rationally" (1977:341-2).
This phenomenological view of institutions followed from the work of its primary progenitors, Berger and Luckmann, who characterized institutions — in an even more often quoted passage — as involving "a reciprocal typification of habitualized actions by types of actors" (1967:54). The phenomenological focus on the process of institutionalization at a micro level, however, should not obscure the fact that
the very existence of a formal organization as a totality depends entirely on the behavior, and therefore on the intersubjectively derived cognitions of its members.
