The second stage of competition is more familiar. Audiences observe the offers made by legitimate players and choose the one that seems most attractive. Players, in turn, vie with one another to promote their offers to audiences. Each player tries to differentiate its offer from those advanced by its peers and establish its relative desirability. Thus, differentiation works hand in hand with isomorphism (cf. Porac and Thomas 1990; Baum and Haveman 1997).
