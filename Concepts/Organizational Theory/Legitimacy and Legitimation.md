Parsons was sage of this mythology, as translator and
interpreter of Weber and as theorist in his own right. Thus,
he defined legitimation as "appraisal of action in terms of
shared or common values in the context of the involvement of
the action in the social system" (1960:175).

The
following passage from Berger and Luckmann (1967) is
illustrative:
Legitimation as a process is best described as a
'second-order' objectivation of meaning. Legitimation
produces new meanings that serve to integrate the
meanings already attached to disparate institutional
processes. The function of legitimation is to make
objectively available and subjectively plausible the
'first-order' objectivations that have been
institutionalized. (1967:92)

Collins, for example, offered this definition:
"legitimation is a social process that produces solidarity
by calling on the emotional reactions of people to symbolic
communication" (1975:58). For Beetham, legitimacy means "for
those subject to power to support and cooperate with its
holders; grounds, that is to say, not for belief, but for
obligation" (1991:13). 

Beetham presented this definition
explicitly in opposition to Weber's emphasis on subordinates'
beliefs (and not actions) as the basis for superiors'
legitimacy, where such beliefs are themselves derived from the
normative order justifying a particular hierarchy.
