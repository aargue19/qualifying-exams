#isomorphism
From [[DiMaggio & Powell, 1983 - The Iron Cage Revisited]]:
"The concept that best captures the process of homogenization is isomorphism. In [[@Hawley, Ellis W.]] (1968) description, isomorphism is a constraining process that forces one unit in a population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions."

According to [[Hannan & Freeman, 1977 - The Population Ecology of Organizations]] isomorphism is a result of non-optimal forms being selected out.

Can be coercive, mimetic, normative.

[[Selznick, 1996 - Institutionalism Old and New]]

Organizations tend to model themselves after similar organizations in their field that they perceive to be more legitimate or successful. The ubiquity of certain kinds of structural arrangements can more likely be credited to the universality of mimetic processes than to any concrete evidence that the adopted models enhance efficiency. (DiMaggio and Powell, 1991: 70)
