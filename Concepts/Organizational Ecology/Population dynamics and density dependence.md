Population dynamics is how the number of prior foundings and failures in a population influence current rates of founding (Delacroix and Carroll, 1983).

Previous patterns of organizational founding and failure in a population can influence current rates of founding (Delacroix and Carroll 1983). Initially, prior foundings signal a fertile niche to potential entrepreneurs, encouraging foundings. But as foundings increase further, competition for resources increases, discouraging foundings. Prior failures are predicted to have a similar curvilinear effect on foundings. At first, failures release resources that can be reassembled into new foundings. But further failures signal a hostile environment, discouraging foundings. Prior foundings and failures can also lower failure rates. The resources freed up by prior failures enhance the viability of established organizations, lowering the failure rate in the next period (Carroll and Delacroix 1982). Waves of organizational founding, which reflect differentiation that segments organizations' resource requirements, lower the failure rate by reducing direct competition for resources (Delacroix et al. 1989).

Density-dependent explanations for founding and failure are similar though not identical. Initial increases in population density can increase the institutional legitimacy of a population. The capacity of a population's members to acquire resources increases greatly when those controlling resources take the organizational form for granted. However, as a population continues to grow, the interdependence among a population's members becomes competitive. When there are few organizations in a population, competition with others for scarce common resources can be easily avoided. But, this becomes more difficult as the number of potential competitors grows. Combined, the mutualistic effects of initial increases in density and the competitive effects of further increases suggest curvilinear effects of population density on founding and failure rates (Hannan and Carroll 1992Í¾ Hannan and Freeman 1989).
