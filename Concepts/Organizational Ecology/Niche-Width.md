In the initial statement of organizational ecology, Hannan and Freeman (1977) use nichewidth theory to formulate a model of the differential survival capabilities of
specialist organizations, which possess few slack resources and concentrate on ways to exploit a narrow range of potential customers, and generalist organizations, wich attempt to appeal to the average consumer who occupies the middle of the market and exhibit adaptive tolerance for more widely varying environmental conditions. Building on fitness-set theory (Levins 1968), Hannan and Freeman focus on two aspects of environmental variation to explain the relative prevalence of specialists and generalists. The first, variability, refers to the variance in environmental fluctuations about their mean over time. The second, grain, refers to the patchiness of these variations, with many, small periodic variations being finegrained and few large, periodic variations being coarse-grained.
