In the [[Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]] [[@Weber, Max]] warned that competition among capitalist firms in markets led to demands for rationality (bureaucracy) and this had become an iron cage in which humanity is imprisoned.

But organizations seem to be becoming more similar without being more efficient, i.e. isomorphism doesn't seem to be driven by competition, but rather something different.

It's because highly structured organizational fields provide a context in which individual efforts to deal rationally with uncertainty and constraint often lead, in-the aggregate, to homogeneity in structure, culture, and output.w

p. 148
But new practices can become, in Selznick's words (1957:17), "infused with value beyond the technical requirements of the task at hand." As an innovation spreads, a threshold is reached beyond which adoption provides legitimacy rather than improves performance (Meyer and Rowan, 1977). Strategies that are rational for individual organizations may not be rational if adopted by large numbers. Yet the very fact that they are normatively sanctioned increases the likelihood of their adoption.

From [[DiMaggio & Powell, 1983 - The Iron Cage Revisited]]:
"The concept that best captures the process of homogenization is isomorphism. In [[@Hawley, Ellis W.]] (1968) description, isomorphism is a constraining process that forces one unit in a population to resemble other units that face the same set of environmental conditions."

According to [[Hannan & Freeman, 1977 - The Population Ecology of Organizations]] isomorphism is a result of non-optimal forms being selected out.

Pressures for competitive efficiency are also mitigated in many fields because the number of organizations is limited and there are strong fiscal and legal barriers to entry and exit. Lee (1971:51) maintains this is why hospital administrators are less concerned with the efficient use of resources and more concerned with status competition and parity in prestige.

p. 157
A focus on institutional isomorphism can also add a much needed perspective on the political struggle for organizational power and survival that is missing from much of population ecology. 

The institutionalization approach associated with John Meyer and his students posits the importance of myths and ceremony but does not ask how these models arise and whose interests they initially serve.



Theory: At the organizational (field) level there are isomorphic processes that lead to organizations becoming more homogeneous in structure, process and behavior: coercive (constraint), mimetic (modeling), and normative (professional filtering/networks).

Hypotheses: Organizational predictors are: dependence, centralization, uncertainty, ambiguity, status (credentials). Field-level predictors are: dependence, transactions, alternatives, technological uncertainty, professionalization.
