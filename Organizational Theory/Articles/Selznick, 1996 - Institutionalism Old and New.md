Nor do significant differences appear in the way "institution" and "institutionalization" are defined. Nevertheless, several new directions are taken. Among these is the focus on legitimation as a sustained and driving force among organizational actors. Legitimacy is seen as an organizational "imperative" that is both a source of inertia and a summons to justify particular forms and practic

The justifications encourage institutional mimicry or mimesis, which means that the organization is highly sensitive to the cultural environment within which it liv

p. 274
The new theorists rightly give great weight to "structured cognition." This very useful idea reminds us that the interaction of culture and organization is mediated by socially constructed mind, that is, by patterns of perception and evaluation. People in organizations live with (and welcome) bounded rationality, and they cope with uncertainty by relying on routines, which may become rituals. These and other insights help us look closely at organizational processes, thereby identifying very specific ways of thinking and acting. As we do so, we gain a better understanding of how minds are formed in organizational contexts, with significant consequences for interaction and decision making. This is not exactly "new," given much reliance on writings by James G. March and Herbert Simon, but the wish to give their findings a more central place in institutional theory (if that is possible) is very welcome.

p. 275
Instead of a carefully designed and tightly controlled organization we are invited to see loose coupling and even organized anarchy. This emphasis on the openness of systems undercuts the idea that organizations are mainly devices for achieving specific objectives. Because many stated "goals" are too vague and abstract to be effective in determining policy choices, we must infer operative goals from actual practice. Therefore, the typical large organization is better understood as a coalition, governed by multiple rationalities and negotiated authority, than as a unified system of coordination. These coalitions have permeable boundaries; if they are to survive and flourish they must engage in complex transactions with the environments they depend on and which they may control.

p. 276
The "old" institutional theory, including the institutional economics of John R. Commons and his generation, was deeply interested in the vitality and coherence of institutions. To be truly successful, the "new" institutionalism must find its place within that tradition

A sign of this condition is the fact that in ordinary speech "bureaucracy" retains strongly negative connotations. During the past forty years we social scientists have struggled against that exercise in stigma. We have tried to define bureaucracy in a more neutral way, recognizing that the pathologies of bureaucracy are real and endemic, but insisting that they should be considered contingent, not essential, subject to remedy, not inevitable. Obviously, we have not won this fight for high ground in public discourse.
