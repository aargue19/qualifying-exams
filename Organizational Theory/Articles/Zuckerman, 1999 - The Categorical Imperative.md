The answer to the question of “Why there is such . . . homogeneity to organizational forms and practices?” (DiMaggio and Powell 1983, p. 148) is that organizations that do not meet institutionalized expectations for how they should look and act are viewed as illegitimate. The threat of being denied legitimate standing in turn induces organizations to adopt accepted procedures. Organizational variety decreases accordingly.

Nevertheless, the vast majority of innovations fail in part because of the difficulties they face in achieving legitimacy (Stinchcombe 1965; Hannan and Carroll 1992).

p. 1430
A distinctive aspect of the analysis presented here is that I derive network effects not from an actor’s structural position but from how that position relates to the ideal-typical one implied by a desired identity.

Theory: In markets where the audience's interpretation is mediated by a small number of concentrated, influential reviewers the success of a product is influenced by whether or not the reviewers recognized it as a legitimate category member (reviewed it).

Method: U.S. data on securities analysts and stock performance. Predict performance based on "coverage mismatch" (proportion of appropriate industry specialists reviewers that rate a fund).
