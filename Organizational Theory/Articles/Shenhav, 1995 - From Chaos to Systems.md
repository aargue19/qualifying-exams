p. 557
The main argument is that the systems perspective in the management of organizations was crystallized within mechanical engineering during the last decades of the nineteenth century and was institutionalized as a legitimate canonical discourse during the Progressive period (1900-1917). Three factors were instrumental in facilitating this process: (1) The professionalization of mechanical engineering; (2) the political culture of Progressivism; and (3) the politics of labor unrest.

Most textbooks regard his "Shop Management" (1903) and "Principles of Scientific Management" (1911) as the first chapters in the theory of organizations (e.g., Scott, 1992).

"the Taylor system was a comprehensive answer to the problem of factory coordination, a refinement and extension of systematic management . .. [and] a thinly concealed effort to attract attention to scientific management by exploiting interest in labor unrest" (Nelson, 1974: 480, 486).

p. 567
According to this engineering rhetoric, the properties of the machine-like system were expected to transform chaos into order, ambiguity into certainty, and irrational into rational behavior

Method:
DV: 
- To operationalize interest in systems thinking, I used the yearly cumulative volume (number of pages) of items published on systems as a percentage of the volume devoted to management issues.

IVs: 
- The professionalization variable was measured using the annual membership in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
- Progressivism is a dummy variable coded 1 for the years 1900-1917 and 0 otherwise
- I used the customary measure, the number of strikes, as a measure of the level of labor discontent. Data on the annual frequency of strikes during the period 1880-1932 were compiled from the official publication of the United States Department of Labor (Peterson, 1938)
