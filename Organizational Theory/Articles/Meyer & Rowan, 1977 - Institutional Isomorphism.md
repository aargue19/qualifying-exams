Title: Institutionalized Organizations: Formal Structure as Myth and Ceremony

Authors: [[@Meyer, John]], [[@Rowan, Brian]]

Notes:

p. 342
Much emprical research casts doubt on the idea that organizations function according to their formal blueprints.

p. 343
Previous theories treated legitimacy as a given and theories about bureaucratization assumed norms of rationality were built into society. But they are instead manifestations of of institutional rules which function as rationalized myths that are binding on organizations.

p. 346
Institutional theories in their extreme forms define organizations as dramatic enactments of the rationalized myths pervading modern societies, rather than units involved in exchange with their environments.

Organizations both deal with their environments at their boundaries and imitate environmental elements in their structures.

p. 349
An important aspect of isomorphism with environmental institutions is the evolution of organizational language, i.e., language used to deliniate organizational goals, procedures, policies, motives. 

Organizations that omit environmentally legitimated elements of structure or create unique structures lack acceptable legitimated accounts of their activities and are more vulnerable to claims that they are negligent, irrational, or unnecessary.

p. 350 
Thus, rationalized institutions create myths of formal structure which shape organizations. Failure to incorporate the proper elements of structure is negligent and  irrational; the continued flow of support is threatened and internal dissidents are strengthened. At the same time, these myths present organizations with great  opportunities for expansion. Affixing the right labels to activities can change them into valuable services and mobilize the commitments of internal participants and external constituents.

p. 352
Organizations that incorporate societally legitimated rationalized elements in their formal structures maximize their legitimacy and increase their resources and survival capabilities.

p. 357-356
Efficient organizations maintain close alignments between structures and activities. But in institutionalized organizations, if you enforce/control/coordinate such alignment through inspection and quality control, you simply create a record of your shortcomings, i.e., inconsitencies and inefficiencies, which leads to loss of legitimacy. 

p. 357
Thus, decoupling enables organizations to maintain standardized, legitimating, formal structures while their activities vary in response to practical considerations. The organizations in an industry tend to be similar in formal structure-reflecting their common institutional origins-but may show much diversity in actual practice.

p. 360 
Institutional isomorphism leads to decouplling of structural units from eachother and from activities, rituals of confidence and good faith, and avoidance of inspection and evaluation
