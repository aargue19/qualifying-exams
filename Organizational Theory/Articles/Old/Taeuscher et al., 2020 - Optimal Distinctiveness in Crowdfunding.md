Journal: [[Academy of Management Journal]]

Theory: One new mechanism and three contingencies for optimal distinctiveness. When audiences are novelty-expecting the legitimating effect of distinctiveness intensifies. Relationship between distinctiveness and resource acquisition decreases when alternative sources exist.

Method: Data from Kickstarter. Predict number of backers using distinctiveness (strory deviates from prototype), normative appropirateness (contribution claims) and market category familiarity.
