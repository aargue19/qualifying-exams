Authors: [[@Phillips, Damon]] [[@Zuckerman, Ezra]]

Year: 2001

Journal: [[American Journal of Sociology]]

Theory: Audience selection is a two-stage process: first screen out illegitimate candidates then choose among the remaining ones;  combinations of actors' role incumbancy and status influences their conformity to classification system. Empirically validate IUS conjecture.

Method: Data from Silicon Valley law firms and U.S. securities analyst firms. Predict IUS relationship between conformity and status.
