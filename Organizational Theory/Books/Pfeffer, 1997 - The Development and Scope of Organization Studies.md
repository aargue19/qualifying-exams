Notes:

To understand or analyse organizations, it is important to consider the locus of causality and whether that is lodged in individuals, situations, or some combination. The locus of causality directs where we place our research emphasis and how we go about understanding and affecting behavior. (p. 5)

Scott noted that, "most analysts have conceived of organizations as social structures created by individuals to support the collaborative pursuit of specified goals" (Scott, 1992, p. 10) 

Organizations have at least one goal - to survive and grow (self-perpetuation). But an organization is viable only so long as the inducements-contribution balance is positive, such that the available infucements are sufficient to produce the voultary contributions of participation and effort necessary to maintain the organization. 

Organizations have a connection to the state that confers legitimacy that distinguishes them from less formal collectives such as families, mobs, or informal groups.

Organizations can be distinguished by the nature of their boundaries. Certain units of the organization are boundary-spanning (deal with the outside world) like purchasing, human resources, marketing, public relations. 

The study of organizations (management, administration and leadership) has always found a home in business schools because of continuing interest in subjects such as motivation, human effects on productivity and performance, and organizational structure and strategy. (p.13)
