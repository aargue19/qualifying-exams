Notes:

Ch. 7. 

Structutal Contingency Theory: There is no best way to organize and any way of organizing is not equally as effective for all. (158)

Cosonance hypothesis: Organizations that have structures that fit the "requirements of the context" will be more effective and oganizations adapt their structure by moving out of misfit ([[@Pfeffer, Jeffery]], 1982: 148) (158)

Support for this theory was inconsistent (p.162)

According to Organizational Ecology changes in orgainizational populations arise largely through the processes of organizational birth and death, not just the adaptation of individual organizations. 

Older orgs. have more inertia and are harder to change. (165)

Both founding and mortality depend on density in many organizational populations. Also depend on legitimacy and competition. (165)

There is a curvilinear effect of density on organizational founding. Many examples given on p. 166

Lots of examples of density dependence on page 167.

There is a trade-off between strategies of choosing organizational niche. According to Barnett et al. (1994) if an organization insulates itself from competitive pressure it fails to acheive organizational learning from competition experience (p. 168)

There are 4 perspecives on organizational performance, SCT, OE, HRM, SNA (176)
