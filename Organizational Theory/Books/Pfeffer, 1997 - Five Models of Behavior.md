Notes:
Economic models exclude social context or social relations almost entirely, except tangentially and indirectly.

The social model of behavior emphasizes the embedded nature of behavior [[@Granovetter, Mark]]  (1985)

According to [[@Blau, Peter M.]] "the study of social structure centers attention on the distribution of people among different positions and their social associations."

"Orgs are inescapably bound up with the conditions of their #environment" ([[@Pfeffer, Jeffery]] & [[@Salanick, Gerald R.]] (1978, p. 1)

Examples:

social_networks, social_capital,  interfirm ties, board composition, etc.... affect cognition,  affect job-finding, affect perceptions of work environment etc.. (p.54-55)

Strategic_management is also affected by interfirm ties. (p.57)

[[@Haveman, Heather, A.]] (1993) studies the entry of California savings and loans into six new markets over time, he found evidence of imitation: firms were more likely to enter a market in a diven period the greater the number of large firms and the greater the number of profitable firms that had perviously done so.
