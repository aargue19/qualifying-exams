Notes: 

One of the main contributions of the open systems perspective is the recognition that many systems - especially social systems - contain elements that are only weakly connected to others and capable of fairly autonomous actions (Ashby, 1968; Glassman, 1973; Weick, 1976) (p.93)

Natural systems perspective says that the normative structure of an organization is only loosely coupled with its behavioral structure. Rules do not always govern actions: a rule may change without affecting behavior, and vice versa. (p.93)

Open systems have boundaries and must expend energy in boundary maitenance, e.g. spanning, re-drawing. (p. 95)

General systems theorists elaborate the distinction between closed anf open sustems by employing the concept of entropy : energy that cannot be turned into work. (p. 96)

The term morphostasis refers to those processes that tend to preserve or maintain a system’s given form, structure, or state. Morphostatic processes in biological systems would include circulation and respiration; in social systems, socialization and control activities. Morphogenesis refers to processes that elaborate or change the system—for example, growth, learning, and differentiation. (p.97)

Open system scholars emphasis process over structure. Also, evolutionary theory is introduced to support studies of change, as new elements are introduced, selected or rejected, and retained. The cultural and cognitive dimensions of social life loom large in the open systems perspective. Great attention is devoted to information flows and sense-making activities. Organizations create, but also, appropriate knowledge, knowhow, and meaning from their environments.
