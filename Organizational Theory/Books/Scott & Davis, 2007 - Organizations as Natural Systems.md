Notes: 

For Selznick, "the most important thing about organizations is that, though they are tools, each nevertheless has a life of its own" (1949: 10) (p. 73)

One of the most important insights of the natural system perspective is that the social structure of an organization does not consist of the formal structure plus the idiosyncratic beliefs and behaviors of individual participants, but rather of a formal structure and an informal structure: informal life itself structured and orderly. (p. 63)

According to [[@Barnard, Chester I.]] it is a fiction that authority comes down from above. He says, "the decision as to whether an order has authority or not lies with the persons to whom it is addressed, and does not reside in 'persons of authority' or those who issue the orders"

According to [[@Barnard, Chester I.]], organizational forces can be more powerful than purpose. In his book The Functions of the Executive (p. 89), he says, "Finally it should be noted that, once established, organizations change their unifying purposes. They tend to perpetuate themseelves; and in the effort to survive may change the reasons for existence" 

"The necessity of survival can override the morality of purpose" (p. 72)

[[@Selznick, Phillip]] argued that the most significant aspect of #institutionalization is the process by which structures or activities becom "infused with value beyond the technical requirements at hand" (Selznick, 1957: 17) 

The rational system perspective is mechanistic, the natural model is an organic model. 

Rational systems are designed, but natural systems evolve.

Rational systems develop by concious design, natural systems by natural growth
