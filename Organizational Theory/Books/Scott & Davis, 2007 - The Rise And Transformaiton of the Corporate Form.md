Notes: 

[[@Simmel, Georg]] 1955 talks about social arrangements as containing overlapping and intersecting systems. Each new group an individual becomes affiliated with circumscribes him more exactly and unambiguously. As the person becomes affiliated with a social group he surrenders himself to it. A group is the synthesis of subjective affiliations. Identity is framed as the intersection of an individual's web of affiliations. (p. 345)

The law of corporations has reflected an antinomy in society. Are corporations merely legal fictions holding a place in a web of contracts or are they social entities? [[@Allen, William]] discusses this in an article called "Our Schizophrenic Conception of the Corporation" (p.347)
