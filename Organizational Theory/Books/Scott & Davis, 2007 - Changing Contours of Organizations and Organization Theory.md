Notes: 
In 1982, [[Mohr, Lawrence B.]] usefully differentiated between variance and process theories. Variance theories focus attention on characteristics of actors or situations, treating them as abstract variables and examining the ectent of their interdependence. Process theories deal with "a series of occurances of events rather than a set of relations among variables" ( [[Mohr, Lawrence B.]], 1982: 54). Variane questions focus on why things happen - what factors were associated with the observed characteristics of the phenomena of interest, process theories address the question of how the observed effects happened. (p. 377)

Social mechanisms (p.378-379)

Merton says, "sociology will advance insofar as its major (but not exclusive) concern is with developing theories of the middle range, and it will be retarded if its primary attention is focussed on developing total sociological systems" (Merton, 1968: 50-51)

According to Pondy and Mitoff (1979: 7), too many open-system models say that orgs. must defend themselves against environmental complexity, and fail to recognize that "it is precisely throughput of nonuniformity that preserves the differential structure of an open organization" ()
