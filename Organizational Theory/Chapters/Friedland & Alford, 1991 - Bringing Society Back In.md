Notes: 

Resource dependency theory assumes that organizations have strategic autonomy to negotiate the uncertain resources available in their environments in the interestes of orgainztional survival and power. 

The major counter theory population ecology, it deprives organizations of their strategic autonomy by converting society into an unspecified, abstract set of resources which are either lean or poor, fine-grained or coarse, turbulent or placid.

The psycholocical language of Homer's Iliad suggests that human beings did not imagine themselves as unique selves, whose motivations governed their behavior, but as internally fragmented, their behavior determined by the gods. Individuals saw themselves as expressions of the social roles they occupied. Over the course of three centuries, from Homer to Euridides, the individual emerged, his subjectivity valued, his personality hearalded as an agency of rationality.

Material advantage is sought in terms of cultural categories which are institutionally located, frequently contested, and sometimes reordered. These categories become normative and thereby shape not only the calculus of utility maximization but probably the formation of preferences as well. There is an insturmental politics to the ways in which the categories change, certainly, but once they have become institutionalized they shape the rules by which rationality is percieved and exercised.
