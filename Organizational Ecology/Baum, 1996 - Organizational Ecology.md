Chapter 1.3:
p. 77
- Until the mid 70s the prevailing view was that organizations changed their features to adapt to the environment, but organizational ecologists such as Aldrich & Pfeffer (1976), Hannan and Freeman (1977), and McKelvey (1982) came along and suggested that change is a result of environmental selection processes.
- Organizational Ecology inspired by the question: "Why are there so many kinds of organizations?"

p. 79 
- Baum (1996) breaks it up his review into two sections: 1) Rates of organizational founding and failure, and 2) rates of organizational change

p. 80
- Table: Major Ecological Approaches to Organizational Founding and Failure

p. 84
- Carroll (1985) came up with resource-partitioning which says that when markets get concentrated by large generalists, small specialists exploit peripheral resources. So, as market concentration increases failure rates of large generalists increases while small specialists decreases

p. 88
- Organizational ecologists distinguish between cognitive and socio-political legitimacy. Cognitive is when actors believe an organizational form is the natural way to effect some collective action (Hannan & Carroll, 1992). Socio-political is how embeddedness in relational and normative contexts signals an organizations conformity to social and institutional expectations.

p. 89
- Baum and Oliver (1992) proposed relational density as an alternative hypothesis to density dependence

p. 92
-  Relations among organizational populations are central to ecological theories of organization. Populations develop relationships with other populations engaged in diverse activities that bind them into organizational communities (Astley 1985; Fombrun 1986; Hawley 1950).

p. 107
- One such linkage on which work has already begun is specification of the impacts of ecological dynamics of organizations on jobs and people (Haveman and Cohen 1994; Korn and Baum 1994).
